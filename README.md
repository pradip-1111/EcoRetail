The Problem

Retailers today face mounting pressure to become environmentally responsible, but struggle with:

Lack of real-time sustainability insights – Most stores can't track carbon emissions, waste, or supply chain efficiency accurately.

Manual and inefficient processes – Overstock, spoilage, and poor shelf placement lead to significant product waste.

Difficulty in communicating green efforts – Brands often fail to showcase their eco-friendliness clearly to customers.

Siloed sustainability tools – Existing tools aren't unified or intelligent enough to offer actionable guidance.

Growing consumer expectations – Shoppers prefer eco-conscious brands and expect transparency in sourcing and impact.
